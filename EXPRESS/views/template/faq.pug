                              .bg-title 1. What happens once I place an order for an essay or paper?
                              article.gray-content
                                    p
                                          | You will set up a personal account by your email and a selected password.  You may use this account to monitor the progress of your order. You may also upload additional instructions, samples of your own writing for your writer to review, and use the links to communicate with your writer or with our customer support team.  Once you see alla of the options on your account, you will see how easy it is to use.
                              .bg-title 2. Will my writer and I be able to communicate with one another?
                              article.gray-content
                                    p
                                          | Absolutely!  Once you have your account, you may send and receive messages to and from your writer during the entire process of order fulfillment.  This is an option that other writing services do not offer, since they do not assign specific writers to each task.  CompanyName.com encourages such communication, because we want you to be able to refine instructions and see the progress of your order at any time, day or night.
                              .bg-title 3. What methods of payment can I use and are they secure?

                                    p

                              .bg-title 4. How do you guarantee that I will be satisfied  with your work?
                              article.gray-content
                                    p
                                          | Once you have received your essay, paper, report, etc., you have two days from the email delivery to request revisions. We are happy to make any changes FREE of charge if our writer haven’t followed your instructions precisely. You have 48 hours to apply for a free revision from the moment that order was uploaded in the system. If the final produce does not meet your requirements, you can ask for a refund, and our Quality Control Team will review your complaint. If our writer did not follow your specifications, we will refund your order.
                              .bg-title 5. Will others know I have used your service?
                              article.gray-content

                                          | Only if you choose to tell them!  We have a strict privacy policy, and we never reveal any information about our customers and their orders.

                              .bg-title 6. Can I specify the format or is there a standard one you use?
                              article.gray-content
                                    p
                                          | Our standard format is Arial font, 12 point, double-spaced, with one-inch margins all the way around.  If you need a different format (some instructors require Times New Roman, for example), all you do is let us know when you place your order. You put these types of instructions in the “Comments” box you will find on the order page.
                              .bg-title 7. Do your essays and papers come from pre-written databases?
                              article.gray-content
                                    p
                                          | Absolutely not!  At EssaysService.com, all written work completed for a customer is created from scratch, and follows the specific guidelines set by the customer.  We keep no databases of academic works, and you will never see your work anywhere else. We scan each order with the help of 4 plagiarism search engines and ensure 100% authenticity. If you come across plagiarism in your paper, we will refund your money. However, you will have to send us a Turnitin plagiarism report to prove that our writer plagiarized (which never happens at essaysservice.com).

                              .bg-title 9. How do you set your prices?
                              article.gray-content
                                    p
                                          | Our rates are available on the order form. However, please understand that prices vary depending upon a couple of variables. First, of course, is the urgency of the deadline.  When you place an order that must be completed in a very short period of time, we usually have to assign a few professionals, especially if significant research is required, in order to complete it in a superior manner.  The other component of our pricing system is the academic level of the order.  While a high school term paper can certainly be written by one with a Bachelor’s degree, a college paper will require a writer with at least a Master’s Degree. Orders from graduate students will necessitate a Ph.D. academician, and the charge, of course, will be higher. CompanyName.com  wants to be both fair and reasonable in its pricing, and our policies reflect this commitment.
